SHORT SUMMARY

The Brew & Beans Coffee Ordering Website is a frontend-based web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to simulate an online coffee ordering system where users can browse menu items, place orders, and generate invoices in a simple and user-friendly manner.
The application provides essential features such as user registration, login authentication, cart management, order placement, and invoice generation. The interface is designed to be clean and responsive, ensuring ease of use for customers.
This project helps in understanding the fundamentals of web development and demonstrates how frontend technologies can be used to build interactive web applications.

INTRODUCTION

With the rapid advancement of technology and widespread internet access, online ordering systems have become an important part of modern businesses. Cafes and restaurants are increasingly adopting digital platforms to improve customer convenience and operational efficiency.
The Brew & Beans Coffee Ordering Website is developed to represent a digital ordering platform for a coffee shop. The system allows users to view available coffee products, add them to a cart, and place an order without any physical interaction.
The project includes three main modules: Login and Signup Module, Home Page Module, and Order Management Module. Each module plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth functionality and a better user experience.

METHODOLOGY USED

The development of the Brew & Beans project follows a structured frontend development methodology. The methodology ensures systematic planning, development, and testing of the application.
Requirement Analysis: In this phase, the basic requirements of the system were identified, such as user authentication, menu display, cart functionality, order processing, and invoice generation.
Design Phase: The user interface of the application was designed using HTML and CSS. Special attention was given to layout structure, responsiveness, and readability.
Development Phase: JavaScript was used to implement core functionalities such as login validation, cart operations, order placement, and invoice generation.
Testing Phase: The application was tested to ensure that all features work correctly and provide accurate results.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

The Brew & Beans Coffee Ordering Website is implemented using multiple web pages that work together to provide a complete system.
Login and Signup Page: This module allows users to create an account and log in using valid credentials. Basic validation is applied to ensure correct input.
Home Page: The home page displays information about the café, available coffee menu items, and navigation options. It provides an attractive interface and smooth navigation experience.
Order Page: The order page allows users to add coffee items to the cart, view selected items, remove items if required, and calculate the total bill amount.
Invoice Generation: After placing the order, an invoice is generated displaying order details, date, order ID, and total amount. The invoice can be printed for record purposes.


FUTURE SCOPE

The Brew & Beans Coffee Ordering Website can be further enhanced by implementing additional features to make it suitable for real-world business use.
Online payment gateway integration can be added to allow customers to make digital payments.
A database system can be introduced for permanent storage of user data and order history.
An admin panel can be developed to manage menu items, prices, and customer orders.
Mobile application support and email or SMS notifications can also be added in the future.

CONCLUSION

The Brew & Beans Coffee Ordering Website successfully demonstrates the development of a frontend-based online ordering system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project provides practical exposure to web development concepts and enhances understanding of user interface design and client-side scripting.
Overall, this project highlights the importance of digital solutions in improving customer experience and business efficiency.
